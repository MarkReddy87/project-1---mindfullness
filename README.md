I have chosen to base my first project on mindfullness. This is something that is very important to me personally and I feel it should be a big part of your everyday life no matter who you are.
Everyone has their struggles in this world! I am creating this site to make people aware that there are many things you can do to that will improve the state of your mind, body and general well being.
The stress of a busy life can really takes its toll. I have learned a lot through my own personal journey and would like to share some of what has helped me through the tough times.
On this site I will concetrate on four aspects of wellbeing that I deem to be essential to a healthy balanced mindset. These will include Yoga, Meditation, Self Care and Exercise.
On the home page I will give an overview of each topic and a more detailed list of specific things to focus on.
The second page will be a customer feedback form where the site can collect specific details from a visitor which can then be assessed and from this a personalised minfullness plan to meet their needs can be created. 
The third page will be a gallery with catagorised videos and pictures from external sources relating to the topics covered on the home page to give people an insight to what is out there.
I want to create an peaceful feel to the pages using a consistant soft color scheme paired with images, text, layout and flow to match.
