# Mindfulness - Become a better you

Welcome! [View live Project here](https://markreddy87.github.io/project-1---mindfullness/)

# 1. Purpose of this Project
<p>I have chosen to base my first project on mindfulness. This is something that is very important to me personally and I feel it should be a big part of your daily life no matter who you are. Everyone has their struggles in this world! I am creating this site to make people aware that there are many things you can do to that will improve the state of your mind and body as well as your general well being. The stress of a busy life can really takes its toll. I have learned a lot through my own personal journey and would like to share some of what has helped me through the tough times.</p>

<p>On this site I will concetrate on four aspects of wellbeing that I deem to be essential to a healthy balanced mindset. These will include Yoga, Meditation, Self Care and Exercise.</p>

<p>The home page will give an overview of each topic and a more detailed list of specific things to focus on.</p>

<p>The second page will consist of a customer feedback form which will collect specific user entered information. From this data a personalised minfullness plan can be created to meet their needs.</p>

<p>The third page will be a gallery with catagorised videos and pictures from external sources relating to the topics covered on the home page to give people an insight to what is available on the web.</p>

# 2. User Stories
I wanted to create a peaceful feel to the pages using a consistant soft color scheme paired with images, text and flow to match.

# 4. Future Features

# 5. Typography and Color Scheme
<ul>
    <li>Color Scheme / Font</li>
        <ol>
            <li>I chose a lot of pastel colors that are easy on the eye and calming to the user</li>
            <li>I used a number of color palette sites to broaden my options all of wich are listed below</li>
            <li>With the font it was very important to me that it looked clean and subtle at the same time. Even with so many to choose from on Google Fonts I feel I made the right choice with Raleway and Lato. I used the classic Sans Serif as the fallback.</li>
        </ol>
    <li>Layout / Content</li>
        <ol>
            <li>I wanted to keep it fairly simple with a good flow so the user is not overwhelmed upon entering the site.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give the elements soft edges and be interactive at the same time and I used specific CSS rules to achieve this</li>
            <li>All of the text content was sampled from multiple sources and put into my own words. All the websites I visited for inspiration are listed below</li>
        </ol>
    <li>Imagery</li>
        <ol>
            <li>All the images come from external sources which are credited below</li>
            <li>Imagery was essentail to this project. I wanted all the images to capture attention but not take away from the text content on the page. I handpicked what I thought would best capture the calming mood I was trying to portray.</li>
        </ol>
</ul>

# 8. Testing
[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/)

<p>I used the W3C code validator to test each of my pages and my stylesheet. I got a lot of errors the first time around. I used many unnecessary line breaks which were replaced with padding, I also had to replace ID selectors which I used multiple times with class selectors and I was missing some closing tags for section elements. Though it was quite jarring at first seeing the amount of mistakes I made, the validator clearly outlined where I went wrong and allowed me to pinpoint the missing / broken code quickly and suggest solutions to the problems.</p>
