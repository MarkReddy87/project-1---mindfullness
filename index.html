                    <h2>Yoga</h2>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yoga is an ancient spiritual practice that focuses on strength, flexability and breathing which will boost your mental and physical wellbeing.</li>
                        <li>You don't need much to start, just a matt and a quiet space. This practice can seem daunting at the beginning when you see high level poses but my advice is to start small and build gradually.</li>
                        <li>There is endless content on this topic but I have chosen some beginner classes located on the gallery page which will help you get started.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Meditation</h2>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Meditation is an individual exercise used to focus the mind to achieve an emotionally calm and stable state.</li>
                        <li>There are many different types of meditation. I reccommend starting with a giuded practice (check the gallery) which will talk you through your first experience. You can then move on to more advanced techniques which will introduce breathing patterns or chanting.</li>
                        <li>It is important in this busy life to take a moment to step back a really reconnect with your body, mind and the world around you. Meditation is one of the best ways to do this.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Self-Care</h2>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Self care in short is how you consciously take actions that will promote your own wellbeing. Self care can be physical, emotional, social, mental and spiritual.</li>
                        <li>You need to start asking yourself questions like: Do I get enough sleep? Am I eating the right food? Did I get any fresh air today? Am I getting enough face to face time with friends? Do I have a healthy way to process my emotions?</li>
                        <li>If you find that you are neglecting a certain aspect of your life you must plan and take action. Listen to what YOU need, take time out of your bustling life and take care of yourself.</li>

                    <h2>Exercise</h2>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Exercise is something everyone can easily add to their daily routine. It could be as simple as a short walk before you begin your work day, a trip to the gym or even some organised sports with friends or at a club.</li>
                        <li>It is so important to be outside and connect with nature. There is so much to discover and feel outside the four walls of your house and away from that screen you sit behind all day.</li>
                        <li>Doing this will not only improve your physical wellbeing but it will boost your mood and you will become more adventurous. I have provided some of my favourite Dublin hiking locations on the Gallery page which I hope will spark your interest.</li>
